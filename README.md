# Car Regression Project

The goal of this project is to use multiple regression to predict car prices. We are going to clean, engineer and remove data from the given cars data. We will the go through the remaining data and create visuals and models. Based on the visuals more data will be removed and a model will be created from the remaining data that helps creates a best fit. The model will then be used to predict 20 unknown prices from the data. After the predictions are made they will be submitted in a competition against other models to see which model is the best.

The writeup for this project can be found in the Project-2_Bathon.html file.
